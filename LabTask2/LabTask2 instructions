    Write a shell script nicecp.sh that copies the file named as the first parameter to the file named as the second parameter to the shell script (2.5%).
    
    The shell script needs to check if 2 argumnets were given. It is supposed to exit if there are no 2 arguments (1%).
    The shell script needs to check if the second file already exists and ask the user to confirm whether he/she wants the file named as second parameter overwritten (1%).
    If not, the script exits.Finally, the shell script is supposed to copy the first file to the second one (0.5%).
    Consider that you want to rename all files of a given type (e.g. file extension) to a different filetype. For example, you want to change the file extension of all txt files to text. Write a shell script rename.sh (3%) that:takes two options as arguments. The first argument is the filetype you want to change. The second argument is the filetype you want to change files into.
    Check that the two arguments are actually given. If not, the script is supposed to return a error message and terminate (0.5%).
    In the next step the script needs to find the corresponding filenames. Each file that is considered needs to be checked if it is a file (0.5%) and has read and write permissions (0.5%).
    Once files are found their file extensions need to change: For example, file.txt needs to change to file.text. HINT: check the man page of the command sed (1%).
    Finally, the script needs to output something to the effect of notifying the user that file.txt has been changed to file.text (0.5%).
    
    
    Rewrite the following shell script in a way that it will run using the tcsh and csh programs (1.0%):
    #!/bin/bash
    DIRNAME=/usr/bin
    FILETYPE="shell script"
    LOGFILE=logfile
    file "$DIRNAME"/* | fgrep "$FILETYPE" | tee $LOGFILE | wc -l
    exit 0

    Put the script in a file named rewrite.sh.
